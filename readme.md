# BUS675 - Advanced Business Machine Learning

Welcome! This repo has everything you'll need for the course - lectures, labs, exercises, data, and more.

## What's in here?

- **lectures/** - Jupyter notebooks for each class
- **labs/** - Hands-on assignments (usually take two class periods plus work outside of class)
- **data/** - All the datasets we'll use
- **images/** - All the images from the lectures
- **supplemental/** - Supplemental code, specific to lectures or labs

## How this works

First, you need a GitHub account, so please make one (if you don't already have one), and make sure you sign up for GitHub Education (use your student email) to get those sweet student benefits.

You're going to fork my repository and then clone your fork to your local computer. This gives you your own copy of lectures that you can edit as you see fit. Periodically, when I release a new lecture notebook, I'll ask you to go to your GitHub page and synchronize your fork with my repository. Then, just run `git pull` from your local directory to get your local code up to date. 

**The key thing**: Make sure that as you work, you **commit and push** your changes (don't just commit locally) so I can see your progress.


## What to expect

Lecture notebooks have explanations, code examples, and exercises built right in. Labs are more comprehensive and let you practice with real-world scenarios.

## Questions?

Hit me up via email or just ask in class.
